# gpcr-flexstation-analysis

These scripts are provided to ensure open access to code used in preparation of the manuscript "Li, A., Liu, S., Huang, R., Ahn, S., & Lefkowitz, R. J. (2023). Loss of biased signaling at a G protein-coupled receptor in overexpressed systems." and are intended to be used with data collected from a FlexStation 3 using the settings specified in "FLIPR sample.sda". Scripts in AUC-doseresponse and AUC-YM-PTX should be run in the Windows distribution of MATLAB, version r2021a or above, and are written to correspond to the included 96-well plate experimental layouts. Scripts in datacombiner should be run in a Python 3 environment with pandas and openpyxl installed. All scripts should function with the provided sample data sets.

AUC-doseresponse scripts must be run within the containing "sample" folder.
